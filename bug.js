This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient feature. However, if you encounter unexpected behavior, such as the gradient not appearing or displaying incorrectly, ensure that the `gradient` plugin is enabled in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  Also, check for any conflicting styles that might override the gradient styles.
